# SchedulePlan

## Fall 2020
- Info 201
- Geog 123
- Econ 382
- Music 116
- Math 126

note: my credit will go beyond 18 credits and I will have to either pay additional money or I will have drop one from Info 201, Math 126, Econ 382 and Geog 123. Math 126 doesn't seem necessary according to my major prerequisites.
